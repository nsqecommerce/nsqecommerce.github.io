                        <h4>Introduction</h4>
                        <p>This is a challenge project from N-Squared back-end team to evaluate how good you are with building APIs with Django.</p>
                        <h4>We look for:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Readability: You can write clear code that any devs could read and understand in one go (Think comments, convention, etc.)</li>
                            <li>Simplicity: You can write gimmick-free and straightforward code with no ambiguities</li>
                            <li>Defensiveness: You can cover edge cases and treat user inputs with care</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Ground Rules</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>We prefer well-thought-out solutions over the quick-and-dirty kind. So take your time, if you need it.</li>
                            <li>We accept only completed test covering all the requirements (and recommendations).</li>
                            <li>Submission is done via email (send the link to your repo).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Django Test</h4>
                        <p>You will build a simple API using Django Rest Framework backend application allowing management of schools.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Step 1</h4>
                        <p>The first step focuses on Django setup and models.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Create a Django app, with:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Postgres as a database</li>
                                    <li>Pipenv as a Python dependency manager.</li>
                                    <li>Environment file (for sensitive information, etc.)</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Add models to create the following structure:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Students have a first name, a last name, and a student identification string (20 characters max for each)</li>
                                    <li>Schools have a name (20 char max) and a maximum number of student (any positive integer)</li>
                                    <li>Each student object must belong to a school object</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h4>Step 2</h4>
                        <p>This second step focuses on Django Rest Framework (DRF).</p>
                        <p>Feel free to cover edge cases. (Add a reference to it in your README.md) We encourage you to use ModelViewSet and ModelSerializer classes to automatically handle the different API HTTP methods.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Add Django REST framework library to your project by using <b>Pipenv</b></li>
                            <li>Enable and use the DRF browsable API for testing things manually.</li>
                            <li>Design your API according to specifications below (make sure to test and customize your solution) by creating urls, views, serializers, tests for all your models so that:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Endpoint students/ will return all students (GET) and allow student creation (POST)</li>
                                    <li>Endpoint /schools/ will return all schools (GET) and allow school creation (POST)</li>
                                    <li>Endpoint /schools/:id and /students/:id will return the object by :id (GET) and allow editing (PUT/PATCH) or deleting (DELETE)</li>
                                    <li>Student creation will generate a unique identification string (like random hexadecimal or uuid4 or anything of your choice)</li>
                                    <li>Trying to add a student in a full school (maximum number of student reached) will return a DRF error message</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>References:</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ModelViewSet: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/#modelviewset">https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/viewsets/#modelviewset</a></li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Step 3</h4>
                        <p>This third step focuses on <b>Django Nested Routers</b>.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Add Django Nested Routers library to your project by using Pipenv</li>
                            <li>Design your API according to specifications below:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Endpoint /schools/:id/students will return students who belong to school :id (GET)</li>
                                    <li>Endpoint /schools/:id/students will allow student creation in the school :id (POST)</li>
                                    <li>Your nested endpoint will allow GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE methods on /schools/:id/students/:id</li>
                                    <li>Your nested endpoint will respect the same two last rules of Step 2 too</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <h5>References:</h5>

                        <p>This is a challenge project from N-Squared back-end team to evaluate how good you are with building APIs with FastAPI or Django (choose only 1 framework).</p>
                        <h4>Objective</h4>
                        <p>Your assignment is to build an internal API for a fake financial institution using Python and (FastAPI or Django).</p>
                        <h4>Brief</h4>
                        <p>While modern banks have evolved to serve a plethora of functions, at their core, banks must provide certain basic features. Today, your task is to build the basic HTTP API for one of those banks! Imagine you are designing a backend API for bank employees. It could ultimately be consumed by multiple frontends (web, iOS, Android etc).</p>
                        <h4>Tasks</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Implement assignment using:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Language: Python</li>
                                    <li>Framework: FastAPI or Django</li>

                            </li>
                            <li>There should be API routes that allow them to:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Create a new bank account for a customer, with an initial deposit amount. A single customer may have multiple bank accounts.</li>
                                    <li>Transfer amounts between any two accounts, including those owned by different customers.</li>
                                    <li>Retrieve balances for a given account.</li>
                                    <li>Retrieve transfer history for a given account.</li>
                                </ul>

                        <p>Feel free to pre-populate your customers with the following:</p>
                        <code>
                            [

                        <p>You are expected to design any other required models and routes for your API.</p>
